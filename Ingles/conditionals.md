# Alternatives to if in conditional sentences

We can use the expressions `as long as`, `provied | providing (that)`, `on condition (that)`, or `only if` instead of `if` when we want to emphasize the condition that needs to be present so that something can happen or be done.

- I'll tell you what really happened `as long as` you keep the secret.
- I'll lend you the money `provided (that)` you pay me back next month.
- They will speak to the press `on condition (that)` they remain anonymous sources.
- We will invest the money, but `only if` you can prove that it's a safe investment.

We can also use oter conditional senteces like: `whther or not`, `even if`, `suppose | supposing`.

# Inversion in conditional sentences
In first conditional sentences it's possible to use `should` at the beginning of the sentence instead of if. This form is formal and it's quite common with an imperative form in the main clause.

- `Should` you find the answer, please let me know as soon as possible. == If you find the answer
- `Should` you change your mind, you know where to contact us. == If you change your mind

In the third conditional sentences, we can invert the auxiliary verb had and leave if out. Had we arrived == if we had arrived.

- `Had we arrived` earlier, we could have prevented the incident.
- `Had they looked` further into the data, they might have realised there was a mkstake.


We can also find cases of inversion with this structure: were + subject + to + infinitive. Its is used to talk about future improbable events (like the second conditional).

- `Were we to announce` the truth, we would receive a lot of criticism. == If we annouced.
- `Were they to buy` a new house, they would need to sell the old one first == If they bought.


# Negative forms: should I not, had we not, were we not
When `should`, `had` or `were` are negative, contracted forms are not possible, and `not` is used after the subject.

- `Should you not wish` to retake the test, you must let us know before the end of June.
- `Had you not refused` my invitation, we would have had the most incredible time in our lives.
- `Were you not` my brother, I would call the police.

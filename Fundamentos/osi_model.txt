## Open Systems Interconnection Model 

Is a conceptual model that characterises and standardises the communication 
functions of a telecommunication or computing system without regard to its 
underlying internal structure and technology.

The communications between a computing system are split into seven different 
abstraction layers: Physical, Data Link, Network, Transport, Session, 
Presentation, and Application.
